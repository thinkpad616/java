Certainly! Here's a list of load testing parameters with example values and corresponding testing objectives:

1. **Number of Threads (Users)**:
   - Example Value: Start with 100 threads and gradually increase to 500 threads.
   - Testing Achievement: Evaluate how the system handles varying levels of concurrent user connections.

2. **Ramp-Up Period**:
   - Example Value: Ramp up from 0 to 500 threads over 10 minutes.
   - Testing Achievement: Assess the system's scalability and its ability to handle a gradual increase in user load.

3. **Loop Count**:
   - Example Value: Set loop count to 3.
   - Testing Achievement: Simulate each user performing multiple interactions with the system within a single session.

4. **Duration**:
   - Example Value: Run the test for 1 hour.
   - Testing Achievement: Determine if the system can sustain expected user load over an extended period without degradation.

5. **Think Time**:
   - Example Value: Introduce a random think time between 1 to 5 seconds.
   - Testing Achievement: Mimic realistic user behavior by simulating delays between consecutive interactions.

6. **Assertions**:
   - Example Value: Validate that each response contains a specific string or status code.
   - Testing Achievement: Ensure that the server responds correctly to user requests and maintains expected behavior.

7. **Listeners**:
   - Example Value: Use Aggregate Report to track throughput, response times, and error rates.
   - Testing Achievement: Monitor key performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize system resources.

8. **HTTP Request Defaults**:
   - Example Value: Set default server name, protocol, and port for all HTTP requests.
   - Testing Achievement: Streamline test configuration and ensure consistency across multiple samplers.

9. **HTTP Cookie Manager**:
   - Example Value: Enable cookie management to maintain session state during the test.
   - Testing Achievement: Validate that session-related functionality behaves as expected under load.

10. **CSV Data Set Config**:
    - Example Value: Use a CSV file to provide different user credentials for authentication.
    - Testing Achievement: Test different user scenarios and ensure proper handling of authentication.

11. **Timers**:
    - Example Value: Introduce a constant timer to simulate a steady flow of requests every 2 seconds.
    - Testing Achievement: Maintain a consistent load on the server and assess its performance under sustained pressure.

12. **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
    - Example Value: Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and network throughput of EC2 instances and ECS tasks.
    - Testing Achievement: Identify resource bottlenecks and optimize infrastructure configuration for improved performance.

By combining these parameters with appropriate example values and testing objectives, you can conduct comprehensive load testing to evaluate the performance, scalability, and reliability of your system under various load conditions. Adjust the values based on your specific requirements and expected user behavior.
