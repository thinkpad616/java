To configure a Stepping Thread Group in JMeter to achieve 5 transactions per second (TPS) for every 5 minutes while monitoring CPU usage, you can follow these steps:

1. **Configure Stepping Thread Group:**
   - Right-click on the Test Plan.
   - Add -> Threads (Users) -> Stepping Thread Group.
   - Configure the following settings:
     - Number of Threads (users): Start with 1 thread.
     - Initial Delay: Set to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
     - Start Threads Count: 1
     - Start Threads Time: 0
     - Stop Threads Count: 1
     - Stop Threads Time: 0
     - Flight Time: 1
     - Ramp-up Time: 0
     - Hold Load For: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
     - Target Throughput (TPS): 5
     - Scheduler: Select "Scheduler" and set the Duration to 300 seconds (5 minutes).

2. **Add Sampler(s):**
   - Add the required sampler(s) to the Thread Group (e.g., HTTP Request sampler for POST requests).
   
3. **Monitor CPU Usage:**
   - Configure JMeter to monitor CPU usage using a third-party plugin like PerfMon or using command-line tools like jstat.
   - Set up CPU monitoring to check if the CPU usage exceeds 60% during the test execution.

4. **Run the Test:**
   - Save your Test Plan.
   - Start the test execution.
   - Monitor the CPU usage during the test to ensure it reaches the desired threshold.

By configuring the Stepping Thread Group with the specified settings and adding the necessary samplers, you can achieve 5 TPS for every 5 minutes while monitoring the CPU usage. Adjust the settings as needed based on your specific requirements and environment.
